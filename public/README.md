# Logo Instructions

## Current Logo
The current logo (`logo.svg`) is a placeholder SVG file with a gradient circle and "UBG" text.

## Replacing with the Actual Logo

To replace the placeholder logo with the actual logo from the GitHub issue:

1. Download the logo image from: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ee1a0f8-0507-47b6-bf9c-67b0eab3bfe6
2. Save the image as `logo.svg` or `logo.png` in this directory (`public/`)
3. If you saved it as `logo.png`, update the image path in `src/App.jsx`:
   - Change `<img src="/UBGRedesign/logo.svg"` to `<img src="/UBGRedesign/logo.png"`
4. The logo will automatically display in the header

## Logo Specifications
- Recommended height: 40px (configured in CSS)
- Format: SVG or PNG
- The logo displays in the header alongside the "UBG Redesign" text
